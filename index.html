      <h3>Mitchell Massiah</h3>
      <p>Hi,my name is Mitch and i'm a first year studying computer science at City, University of London.
	  My life has revolved around computer science and music for the past 7 years.
	  Starting off with python before branching off into C++ and html allowed me to love to create short projects
	  and games whenever I had the chance. Outside of computer science Im an avid music lover and love to play the
	  piano, guitar and violin or creating music using FL Studio in my free time. Combining both music and computer
	  science in my projects has given me such a fun challenge and I can't wait for my computing skills to increase
	  so I can branch out and try new areas i've yet to explore.</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Virtual Keyboard</h3>
    <p>
	My project I decided to create was a virtual keyboard, which has dual controls with both mouse and keyboard to allow polyphonism.
	The project utilises a heavy mix of arrays, for loops and switch cases which a lot of mouse and keyboard interaction, with each key
	cleverly mapped to recreate that of an actual keyboard layout that a lot of modern DAW's feature. To improve this I would have wished
	to add sliders for the reverb delay and EQ, to create the ultimate java virtual piano. The piano spans over 2 octaves long
	to allow some variety in whichever you decide to play.
